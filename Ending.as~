You collected "+sum.toString()+" notes out of a possible 80! Congrats, unless it was a mediocre number. It took you a total of "+times.toString()+ " seconds to finish the sleep stages. Way to go...unless, again, that was a bad time. Play again, if you want, there are some different reviews based on how you do.";
