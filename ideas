BRAINSTORMIGN

..

you've been transported to the past and...
...you're trapped. all by yourself! no way back. BUT it's the year 1990..

...and you're in california!

...and you're a fan of the hit indie rock band from the 90s, "Pavement" (not pavement but you know something close?)

all you have in your pants is a couple hundred bucks and uh...slanted and enchanted.

you decide the only way to survive is to copy them.

but first you must assassinate the members of "Pavement"!

...

okay

....

1. just one stage. collect notes.?? AND ANXIETY MEDS or you get too angsty from being alone and...die. via window. 
2. use notes to defeat pavement?

OKAY 



TO-DO:

-anxiety med implementation (just a timer or whatever)
	*controls get worse as need more stuff
-platforming stuff (should be easy)
-clever way of battling pavement?
-MAKE SCREEN WIDE ENOUGH
-note meter!

low priority:
-music (renditions of pavemnt songs?)
-graphics
-intro story...


class: notes

collect X of these in some time
easy enough

20 notes in a level - fill a note-shaped meter composed of squares. fills them sequentially or with reference to whatever it is 

can make notes play certain parts of the audio file?

after getting all note play whole song

transition between songs when collecting if anxiety too high



puzzle-like thing for "assassinating" or converting members of pavement IN THEIR SLEEP. way of how well you do this influences how well they play?

guys that walk back and forth..?
