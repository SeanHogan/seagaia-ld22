my LD22 entry.

theme is around "alone". tentatively, you travel back in time to 1990 in order to pick up a vintage copy of one of "davement"'s demos.

but you're stuck! and alone. you feel scared, and go a little crazy.

you also happen to have your trusty mypod and an illegal rip of their 1992 classic, "....". you decided that the only logical thing to do is to duplicate their songs, release them before they do, and use your biology degree in order to convince them (in their sleep) to join your band.

you must transform the leader, Slephen Milkmass, into ...soemone else


yes.

the game ahs two phases - first is you collect note against a timer, which can be reduced - hafta run back to the exit of course. if you don't find your anxiety meds you go insane and die, or something

2nd phase is you sneak into the houses of the davement members, and you must poison them in their sleep. This of course makes you anxious - depending on how anxious you do that affect how well you poison them and the end.

ending is sarcastic reviews by "Ditchpork" media, based on how well you did or something
